# sound-localization-intensity-mic-array project
Multiple sound source localization using 3D sound intensity microphone array
This work was conducted as part of Master project with colaboration of KAIST and DTU university
The methods and experiments are detaily explained in Master Thesis at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293959259_Master's_Thesis_2014kaist-dtu_FilipFranek

To run the code and generate results as in Doc/Paper_LocalizationOfIncoherentMultipleSourcesUsingAThreeDimensionalSoundIntensityArray_FilipFranek2015.pdf run the code in Code/multi_si_bass.m in Matlab
